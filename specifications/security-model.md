# PAS Security Model

## Executive Summary

The PAS security model implements a zero-trust architecture designed for healthcare environments with strict HIPAA compliance requirements. This document outlines the comprehensive security controls, authentication mechanisms, encryption standards, and access controls that protect privileged access and audit data.

## Security Architecture Principles

### Zero-Trust Architecture
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every access request is authenticated and authorized
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users receive minimum necessary permissions
- **Continuous Monitoring**: All activities are monitored and audited in real-time
- **Assume Breach**: Security controls designed assuming network compromise

## Network Security

### SSH Connection Policy Constraints

#### **Critical Security Constraint: PAS Server SSH Connection Policy**
The PAS Server (Parent) operates under a strict security policy regarding SSH connections:

- ✅ **PAS Server MAY receive SSH connections** from other components
- ❌ **PAS Server MAY NOT initiate SSH connections** to any other component
- ✅ **Other components initiate SSH connections TO PAS Server**

This constraint ensures:
- **Clear security boundaries** - PAS Server never reaches out to potentially compromised zones
- **Audit compliance** - All SSH connections are inbound to the controlled DMZ environment
- **Network security** - Prevents PAS Server from being used as a pivot point for attacks
- **Operational security** - Reduces attack surface by limiting outbound connections

#### **SSH Connection Patterns**
```yaml
# Allowed SSH connection patterns
ssh_connections:
  allowed:
    - source: "UCM Clients (Internet Zone)"
      destination: "PAS Server/Audit (DMZ)"
      purpose: "User session tunnels"

    - source: "Gatekeeper (Internal Zone)"
      destination: "PAS Server (DMZ)"
      purpose: "RSS protocol communication"

    - source: "Other PAS Components"
      destination: "PAS Server (DMZ)"
      purpose: "System coordination"

  prohibited:
    - source: "PAS Server (DMZ)"
      destination: "Any external component"
      reason: "Security policy violation"
```
