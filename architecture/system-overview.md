## Network Architecture

### Security Zones

#### Internet Zone
- **Components**: End user devices with UCM client
- **Security Level**: Untrusted network
- **Access Pattern**: Outbound HTTPS and SSH connections only
- **Data Protection**: All communication encrypted in transit

#### Customer DMZ
- **Components**: PAS Server, Audit Process, Database
- **Security Level**: Semi-trusted with controlled access
- **Access Pattern**: Inbound from Internet, outbound to Internal
- **Data Protection**: Encrypted storage, comprehensive audit logging

#### Customer Internal Network
- **Components**: Gatekeeper, Target Services
- **Security Level**: Trusted internal network
- **Access Pattern**: Inbound from DMZ, access to target services
- **Data Protection**: Network segmentation, access controls

### Communication Patterns

#### User Access Flow
1. **Authentication**: User authenticates via HTTPS to PAS Server
2. **Authorization**: PAS Server validates access permissions
3. **Session Request**: User requests access to specific service
4. **Tunnel Establishment**: SSH tunnels created between UCM and Audit
5. **Service Connection**: Gatekeeper proxies connection to target service
6. **Session Monitoring**: All traffic recorded and analyzed by Audit

#### Protocol Communication
- **RSS Protocol**: Custom protocol over SSH for component coordination
- **HTTPS**: Web interface and API communication
- **SSH**: Secure tunneling for all privileged access
- **Native Protocols**: SSH, RDP, HTTP preserved for target services

    Note over U,S: Secure session established
```

### **Multi-Session SSH Architecture**

The PAS system employs a sophisticated **four-session SSH architecture** for different purposes:

#### **SSH Session Types**
1. **CM (Connection Manager) Session**
   - **Purpose**: RSS protocol communication and coordination
   - **SSH User**: `rss_scm`
   - **Credentials**: Pre-configured `connectKey`
   - **Port**: 7894 (RSS protocol)

2. **User Session**
   - **Purpose**: User-specific tunneling and port forwarding
   - **SSH User**: `rss_user_session`
   - **Credentials**: Ephemeral `ckValue`/`ckValueEC` (2-minute expiry)
   - **Port**: 7891 (user session)

3. **Nexus Session (CPAM/VPAM Bridge)**
   - **Purpose**: Cross-system seamless connections
   - **SSH User**: `rss_user_session`
   - **Credentials**: Ephemeral keys via SEAMLESSATTACH
   - **Scope**: Connects to different PAS servers

4. **Gatekeeper Application Sessions**
   - **Purpose**: Application-specific connections
   - **SSH User**: `rss_gk_session`
   - **Credentials**: `sessionPrivateKey` from Parent (distributed via RSS CMD_CONNECT)
   - **Note**: This is SEPARATE from Gatekeeper's main `connectKey` which is self-generated

#### **Gatekeeper SSH Credential Architecture**

**Important Distinction**: Gatekeeper uses **two different types** of SSH credentials:

1. **Main Connection Key (`connectKey`)**:
   - **Generation**: Self-generated by Gatekeeper during registration
   - **Distribution**: Only public key sent to PAS Server via HTTPS registration
   - **Storage**: Private key stored locally on Gatekeeper
   - **Purpose**: Main SSH connection from Gatekeeper to PAS Server
   - **Security**: ‚úÖ **SECURE** - No private key distribution

2. **Application Session Keys (`sessionPrivateKey`)**:
   - **Generation**: Generated by PAS Server for each application session
   - **Distribution**: Private key sent from PAS Server to Gatekeeper via RSS CMD_CONNECT
   - **Purpose**: Application-specific SSH connections
   - **Security**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITY** - Private key distribution

**Key Credential Flows**:
- üîí **Secure**: Gatekeeper `connectKey` (self-generated, public key only to server)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Distributed**: UCM session keys (`ckValue`/`ckValueEC` to Internet zone)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Distributed**: Application session keys (`sessionPrivateKey` to Gatekeeper)

## Security Architecture Analysis

### Current Security Posture Assessment

#### **Credential Distribution Analysis**

**Secure Implementations** ‚úÖ:
- **Gatekeeper Main Connection**: Self-generated `connectKey`, only public key sent to server
- **Component Authentication**: Proper public key infrastructure for main connections
- **Session Isolation**: Different SSH users for different session types

**Areas for Improvement** ‚ö†Ô∏è:
- **UCM Session Keys**: `ckValue`/`ckValueEC` distributed to Internet-connected devices
- **Application Session Keys**: `sessionPrivateKey` distributed to Gatekeeper for each application
- **Cross-Zone Distribution**: Private keys flowing from secure DMZ to less secure zones

#### **Security Improvement Opportunities**

1. **Reverse Tunnels for Application Sessions**:
   - **Target**: Eliminate `sessionPrivateKey` distribution to Gatekeeper
   - **Method**: Use reverse tunnels over existing `connectKey` SSH connection
   - **Impact**: Reduces application session credential exposure

2. **Certificate-Based Authentication for UCM**:
   - **Target**: Replace `ckValue`/`ckValueEC` distribution with certificates
   - **Method**: SSH certificate authority on PAS Server
   - **Impact**: Eliminates private key distribution to Internet zone

3. **LibRSSConnect Migration**:
   - **Target**: Consolidate protocol implementations and enable reverse tunnels
   - **Method**: Migrate Java Connect to C++ LibRSSConnect
   - **Impact**: Single implementation with built-in reverse tunnel capability

## Security Model

### Network Security Constraints

#### **SSH Connection Policy**
The PAS system operates under strict SSH connection policies to maintain security boundaries:

**Critical Constraint**: The PAS Server (Parent) **MAY NOT initiate SSH connections** to any other component. It can only receive inbound SSH connections.

**Rationale**:
- **Security Isolation**: Prevents PAS Server from being used as a pivot point for attacks
- **Audit Compliance**: All SSH connections are inbound to the controlled DMZ environment
- **Network Security**: Reduces attack surface by limiting outbound connections
- **Operational Security**: Clear security boundaries with controlled access patterns

**Connection Patterns**:
- ‚úÖ **UCM Clients ‚Üí PAS Server**: User session tunnels (Internet ‚Üí DMZ)
- ‚úÖ **Gatekeeper ‚Üí PAS Server**: RSS protocol communication (Internal ‚Üí DMZ)
- ‚úÖ **Components ‚Üí PAS Server**: System coordination (Various ‚Üí DMZ)
- ‚ùå **PAS Server ‚Üí Any Component**: Prohibited by security policy

### Authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Integration with customer identity systems
- **Certificate-Based**: SSH certificates for component authentication
- **Session Tokens**: Time-limited tokens for web interface access
- **Key Rotation**: Automated SSH key rotation for enhanced security

### Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions based on user roles
- **Time-Based Restrictions**: Access limited to approved time windows
- **Service-Specific Policies**: Different policies for different target services
