### Primary Objectives
- **Secure Privileged Access**: Control and monitor all privileged access to critical systems
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Ensure all access patterns meet healthcare privacy requirements
- **Comprehensive Auditing**: Record and analyze all privileged sessions for compliance and security
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Authenticate, authorize, and audit every access attempt

### Target Environment
- **Healthcare Organizations**: Hospitals, clinics, and healthcare service providers
- **On-Premises Deployment**: Customer-controlled infrastructure with RPM-based deployment
- **Private Cloud**: Customer-managed cloud environments with strict data residency
- **Hybrid Environments**: Mixed on-premises and private cloud deployments

## Network Architecture

### Security Zones

#### Internet Zone
- **Components**: End user devices with UCM client
- **Security Level**: Untrusted network
- **Access Pattern**: Outbound HTTPS and SSH connections only
- **Data Protection**: All communication encrypted in transit

#### Customer DMZ
- **Components**: PAS Server, Audit Process, Database
- **Security Level**: Semi-trusted with controlled access
- **Access Pattern**: Inbound from Internet, outbound to Internal
- **Data Protection**: Encrypted storage, comprehensive audit logging

#### Customer Internal Network
- **Components**: Gatekeeper, Target Services
- **Security Level**: Trusted internal network
- **Access Pattern**: Inbound from DMZ, access to target services
- **Data Protection**: Network segmentation, access controls

### Communication Patterns

#### User Access Flow
1. **Authentication**: User authenticates via HTTPS to PAS Server
2. **Authorization**: PAS Server validates access permissions
3. **Session Request**: User requests access to specific service
4. **Tunnel Establishment**: SSH tunnels created between UCM and Audit
5. **Service Connection**: Gatekeeper proxies connection to target service
6. **Session Monitoring**: All traffic recorded and analyzed by Audit

#### Protocol Communication
- **RSS Protocol**: Custom protocol over SSH for component coordination
- **HTTPS**: Web interface and API communication
- **SSH**: Secure tunneling for all privileged access
- **Native Protocols**: SSH, RDP, HTTP preserved for target services
