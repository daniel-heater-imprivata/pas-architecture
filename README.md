# PAS System Architecture Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive architecture documentation for the Privileged Access Security (PAS) system, a multi-industry privileged access management solution designed for highly regulated environments including healthcare, financial services, law enforcement, gaming, and government sectors.

## üè• System Overview

The PAS system provides secure privileged access management for highly regulated organizations across multiple industries, enabling controlled access to critical systems while maintaining comprehensive audit trails and regulatory compliance. The system operates in on-premises and private cloud environments with strict data privacy and security requirements.

### Key Characteristics
- **Multi-Industry Compliance**: Supports HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, GDPR, and various regulatory frameworks
- **Global Deployment**: Serves customers across North America, Europe, and international markets
- **On-Premises Deployment**: RPM-based deployment to customer sites with data sovereignty
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: All access is authenticated, authorized, and audited
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: SSH, RDP, HTTP/HTTPS, VNC, and custom protocols
- **Real-Time Auditing**: Complete session recording and analysis

- **Financial**: PCI DSS, SOX, Basel III, MiFID II
- **Law Enforcement**: CJIS, various national security standards
- **Gaming**: State gaming commission regulations
- **Data Protection**: No PII/PHI in system logs, comprehensive audit trails
- **Encryption**: At rest and in transit across all sectors
- **Access Controls**: Role-based with fine-grained permissions

### Operational Excellence
- On-premises deployment with customer control
- RPM-based package management
- Hot-reload configuration management
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### Scalability and Reliability
- Horizontal scaling for high-volume environments
- Fault isolation and graceful degradation
- Automated failover and recovery
- Performance optimization for low-latency access

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Architects
1. Start with [System Overview](architecture/system-overview.md) for high-level understanding
2. Review [Component Model](architecture/component-model.md) for detailed component analysis
3. Examine individual component pages for specific implementation details

### For Developers
1. Review [RSS Protocol Specification](specifications/rss-protocol.md) for protocol details
2. Study [Component Model](architecture/component-model.md) for implementation guidance
3. Check [Recommendations](recommendations/) for development priorities and proposals

### For Operations
1. Review [Deployment Model](specifications/deployment-model.md) for deployment procedures
2. Study component-specific documentation for operational guidance
3. Check [Recommendations](recommendations/) for operational improvements

## üìä System Metrics

### Scale and Performance
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Up to 1,000 simultaneous privileged sessions
- **Session Establishment**: Sub-second connection times
- **Audit Processing**: Real-time session recording and analysis
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-site deployment support

### Compliance and Security
- **Multi-Regulatory Compliance**: HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, GDPR, CJIS, and other frameworks
- **Audit Retention**: Configurable retention periods (90+ days typical)
- **Encryption Standards**: AES-256 encryption for all data
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with fine-grained permissions

## üîÑ Document Maintenance

This documentation is actively maintained and updated to reflect the current system architecture. All changes are tracked through git version control, ensuring complete history and traceability.

### Documentation Philosophy
- **Current State Focus**: Documents represent the current authoritative state without historical context
- **Git Version Control**: All changes, history, and evolution are tracked through git commits
- **Clean Documentation**: No need to document updates or reference previous versions within documents
- **Accuracy First**: Technical accuracy and clarity take precedence over historical documentation

### Update Process
1. **Architecture Changes** - Updated within 1 week of implementation
2. **Protocol Changes** - Updated immediately upon specification changes
3. **Compliance Updates** - Updated within 24 hours of regulatory changes
4. **Operational Changes** - Updated within 1 week of deployment changes
