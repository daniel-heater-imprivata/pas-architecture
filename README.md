# PAS System Architecture Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive architecture documentation for the Privileged Access Security (PAS) system, a healthcare-focused privileged access management solution designed for HIPAA-compliant environments.

## üè• System Overview

The PAS system provides secure privileged access management for healthcare organizations, enabling controlled access to critical systems while maintaining comprehensive audit trails and HIPAA compliance. The system operates in on-premises and private cloud environments with strict data privacy requirements.

### Key Characteristics
- **Healthcare-Focused**: Designed specifically for HIPAA-compliant environments
- **On-Premises Deployment**: RPM-based deployment to customer sites
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: All access is authenticated, authorized, and audited
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: SSH, RDP, HTTP/HTTPS, VNC, and custom protocols
- **Real-Time Auditing**: Complete session recording and analysis
