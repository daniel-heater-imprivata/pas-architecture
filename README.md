# PAS System Architecture Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive architecture documentation for the Privileged Access Security (PAS) system, a multi-industry privileged access management solution designed for highly regulated environments including healthcare, financial services, law enforcement, gaming, and government sectors.

## üè• System Overview

The PAS system provides secure privileged access management for highly regulated organizations across multiple industries, enabling controlled access to critical systems while maintaining comprehensive audit trails and regulatory compliance. The system operates in on-premises and private cloud environments with strict data privacy and security requirements.

### Key Characteristics
- **Multi-Industry Compliance**: Supports HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, GDPR, and various regulatory frameworks
- **Global Deployment**: Serves customers across North America, Europe, and international markets
- **On-Premises Deployment**: RPM-based deployment to customer sites with data sovereignty
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: All access is authenticated, authorized, and audited
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: SSH, RDP, HTTP/HTTPS, VNC, and custom protocols
- **Real-Time Auditing**: Complete session recording and analysis

- Performance optimization for low-latency access

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Architects
1. Start with [System Overview](architecture/system-overview.md) for high-level understanding
2. Review [Component Model](architecture/component-model.md) for detailed component analysis
3. Examine [Current State Analysis](analysis/current-state.md) for improvement opportunities

### For Developers
1. Review [RSS Protocol Specification](specifications/rss-protocol.md) for protocol details
2. Study [Component Model](architecture/component-model.md) for implementation guidance
3. Check [Improvement Recommendations](analysis/recommendations.md) for development priorities

### For Operations
1. Review [Deployment Model](specifications/deployment-model.md) for deployment procedures
2. Study [Configuration Management](recommendations/configuration.md) for operational guidance
3. Examine [Monitoring Strategy](recommendations/monitoring.md) for observability setup

## üìä System Metrics

### Scale and Performance
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Up to 1,000 simultaneous privileged sessions
- **Session Establishment**: Sub-second connection times

## üîÑ Document Maintenance

This documentation is actively maintained and updated to reflect the current system architecture. All changes are tracked through git version control, ensuring complete history and traceability.

### Documentation Philosophy
- **Current State Focus**: Documents represent the current authoritative state without historical context
- **Git Version Control**: All changes, history, and evolution are tracked through git commits
- **Clean Documentation**: No need to document updates or reference previous versions within documents
- **Accuracy First**: Technical accuracy and clarity take precedence over historical documentation

### Update Process
1. **Architecture Changes** - Updated within 1 week of implementation
2. **Protocol Changes** - Updated immediately upon specification changes
3. **Compliance Updates** - Updated within 24 hours of regulatory changes
4. **Operational Changes** - Updated within 1 week of deployment changes
