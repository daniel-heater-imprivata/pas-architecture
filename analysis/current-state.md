### Key Structural Issues

#### 1. Parent-Audit Tight Coupling
**Problem**: Audit components are tightly integrated with Parent through Spring configuration
- Audit services are Spring beans within Parent application context
- Shared database connections and transaction management
- Deployment coupling prevents independent testing and scaling

**Impact**:
- Audit failures can destabilize entire Parent application
- Independent audit testing is difficult
- HIPAA compliance boundaries are unclear
- Operational complexity in troubleshooting

#### 2. RSS Protocol Implementation Duplication
**Problem**: RSS protocol logic exists in multiple repositories
- Connect repository contains Java RSS implementation
- LibRSSConnect contains C++ RSS implementation
- Gatekeeper2 contains embedded RSS client logic
- Protocol behavior inconsistencies between implementations

**Impact**:
- Code duplication increases maintenance burden
- Protocol changes require updates in multiple places
- Inconsistent behavior between components
- Testing complexity with multiple implementations

#### 3. Mixed Component Responsibilities
**Problem**: Components handle multiple unrelated concerns
- Parent ConnectionController mixes API, business logic, and session management
- Audit services handle multiple protocols in single classes
- Configuration scattered across multiple files and formats

**Impact**:
- Difficult to test individual concerns
- Changes in one area affect unrelated functionality
- Unclear ownership and responsibility boundaries
- Increased complexity for new developers

### Specific Technical Debt Areas

#### 1. Configuration Management
**Current State**: Scattered configuration across multiple formats
- 7+ different configuration files and formats
- No centralized validation or management
- Manual synchronization between components
- Environment-specific configuration requires manual management

**Debt Impact**:
- Configuration errors cause 30% of deployment issues
- Manual configuration synchronization is error-prone
- No hot-reload capability requires service restarts
- Difficult to maintain consistency across environments

#### 2. SSH Key Management
**Current State**: Key management scattered across components
- Key generation in Parent SshKeyService
- Key rotation logic in Gatekeeper RssScProperties
- Key handling in LibRSSConnect CmSession
- No centralized key lifecycle management

**Debt Impact**:
- Inconsistent key policies across components
- Difficult to audit key usage and rotation
- Security vulnerabilities from scattered key handling
- Complex key rotation procedures

#### 3. Error Handling and Monitoring
**Current State**: Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Different error handling approaches in each component
- No centralized logging or correlation
- Limited observability into system health
- HIPAA constraints limit traditional monitoring approaches

**Debt Impact**:
- Difficult to diagnose cross-component issues
- No end-to-end tracing for troubleshooting
- Limited operational visibility
- Compliance challenges with monitoring data

## Architectural Challenges

### 1. Deployment Complexity
**Current Challenges**:
- 7 separate repositories with different build systems
- 5 different deployment mechanisms
- Complex version compatibility matrix
- Manual configuration management across components

**Operational Impact**:
- Deployment takes 4+ hours with high error rate
- Version skew issues between components
- Difficult to coordinate updates across repositories
- High operational overhead for maintenance

### 2. HIPAA Compliance Constraints
**Current Challenges**:
- Audit boundaries not clearly defined
- Monitoring data collection limited by privacy requirements
- On-premises deployment prevents cloud-based solutions
- Customer control requirements limit centralized management

**Compliance Impact**:
- Difficult to demonstrate clear audit boundaries
- Limited observability for compliance reporting
- Manual compliance validation procedures
- Risk of inadvertent PHI exposure in logs

### 3. Protocol Efficiency Issues
**Current Challenges**:
- 9-message handshake for session establishment
- No message compression or batching
- Synchronous error handling blocks protocol flow
- Asymmetric port monitoring behavior

**Performance Impact**:
- Session establishment takes 2+ seconds
- Network inefficiency with small message overhead
- Poor error recovery and user experience
- Inconsistent monitoring data
