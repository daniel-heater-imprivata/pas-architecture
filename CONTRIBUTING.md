# Contributing to PAS Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive architecture documentation for the Privileged Access Security (PAS) system. The documentation is designed for enterprise architects, security professionals, development teams, and operations staff working with healthcare-focused privileged access management solutions.

## Documentation Standards

### Writing Guidelines

#### Technical Writing Standards
- **Clarity**: Use clear, concise language appropriate for technical audiences
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology and formatting throughout
- **Accuracy**: Ensure all technical details are accurate and up-to-date
- **Completeness**: Provide sufficient detail for implementation and decision-making

#### Terminology Standards
- **PAS System**: Privileged Access Security system (not "PAS solution" or "PAS platform")
- **Components**: Use official component names (PAS Server, Audit Process, Gatekeeper, UCM Client)
- **Protocols**: Use standard protocol names (RSS Protocol, SSH, HTTPS, TLS)
- **Healthcare Terms**: Use proper healthcare terminology (PHI, HIPAA, covered entity, business associate)

### Document Structure

#### Required Sections
All major documents should include:
1. **Executive Summary**: High-level overview for architects and decision-makers
2. **Technical Details**: Detailed technical information for implementers
3. **Implementation Guidance**: Practical guidance for deployment and configuration
4. **Compliance Considerations**: HIPAA and regulatory compliance information
5. **Cross-References**: Links to related documents and specifications

#### Mermaid Diagrams
Use Mermaid diagrams for visual representations:
- **Architecture Diagrams**: System overviews and component relationships
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Process flows and interactions
- **Network Diagrams**: Network topology and security zones
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: Data movement and processing flows

#### Naming Conventions
- **File Names**: Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Document Titles**: Use Title Case for main headings
- **Section Headers**: Use sentence case for subsections
- **Code Examples**: Use appropriate syntax highlighting

## Content Guidelines

### Architecture Documentation

#### System Architecture
- Focus on component relationships and responsibilities
- Include both current state and proposed improvements
- Provide clear rationale for architectural decisions
- Consider scalability, security, and compliance requirements

#### Technical Specifications
- Include complete interface definitions
- Provide implementation examples where appropriate
- Document error conditions and handling
- Include performance characteristics and limitations

#### Security Documentation
- Address HIPAA compliance requirements explicitly
- Include threat modeling and risk assessment
- Document security controls and their implementation
- Provide configuration guidance for security hardening

### Code Examples

#### Configuration Examples
```yaml
# Example configuration with comments
pas:
  server:
    host: "pas.company.local"
    ports:
      https: 8443  # Web interface port
      rss: 7894    # RSS protocol port
```

#### Implementation Examples
```java
// Example Java code with proper documentation
public class ExampleService {
    /**
     * Example method demonstrating proper documentation
     * @param parameter Description of parameter
     * @return Description of return value
     */
    public String exampleMethod(String parameter) {
        // Implementation details
        return "result";
    }
}
```
