   Consider this research in the context of our reverse tunnel architecture proposal and the constraint that PAS Server cannot initiate SSH connections. Understanding the complete SSH session architecture is critical for properly implementing the reverse tunnel solution and ensuring we account for all credential distribution patterns.
