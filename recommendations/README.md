# PAS System Recommendations

This section contains proposed improvements, enhancements, and strategic initiatives for the PAS system. These documents represent future state proposals and should not be confused with current system architecture.

## üéØ Strategic Initiatives

### Major Architectural Improvements
- **[Audit Separation Strategy](audit-separation.md)** - Proposed audit process separation approach
- **[Integrated Audit Web Strategy](integrated-audit-web-strategy.md)** - Comprehensive audit modernization and web client delivery proposal

### Infrastructure Enhancements
- **[Key Management Integration](key-management.md)** - Integrate with existing key management service
- **[Protocol Optimization](protocol-optimization.md)** - RSS protocol improvements
- **[Monitoring Strategy](monitoring.md)** - Multi-regulatory compliant monitoring approach
- **[Configuration Management](configuration.md)** - RPM-compatible configuration strategy

### Component Migrations
- **[Connect to LibRSSConnect Migration](connect-to-librssconnect-migration.md)** - Strategy for consolidating protocol implementations
- **[IronRDP Integration](ironrdp-integration.md)** - Modern RDP protocol implementation analysis and integration proposal

## üìã Executive Summary

For a high-level overview of all recommendations and their business impact, see:
- **[Executive Summary](EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)** - Prioritized recommendations with business justification

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Guidance

### Proposal Status
All documents in this section represent **proposed future state** and have not been implemented unless explicitly noted. Each proposal includes:

- **Business justification** and expected benefits
- **Technical implementation** approach and timeline
- **Risk assessment** and mitigation strategies
- **Resource requirements** and dependencies

### Decision Process
These proposals require management approval and technical leadership review before implementation. Each document includes decision criteria and success metrics.

## üîÑ Relationship to Current Architecture

These recommendations build upon the current system architecture documented in the main [architecture](../architecture/) section. Key relationships:

- **Current State**: Documented in `/architecture/` - describes what exists today
- **Proposed State**: Documented in `/recommendations/` - describes proposed improvements
- **Technical Specifications**: Documented in `/specifications/` - defines protocols and standards

## üìä Prioritization Framework

Recommendations are prioritized based on:

1. **Business Impact**: Customer requirements and revenue protection
2. **Technical Risk**: Implementation complexity and system stability
3. **Resource Requirements**: Development effort and timeline
4. **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and integration requirements
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Multi-industry compliance benefits

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Decision Makers
1. Review [Executive Summary](EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md) for business overview
2. Examine specific proposals based on business priorities
3. Consider resource allocation and timeline constraints

### For Technical Leaders
1. Review technical implementation details in individual proposals
2. Assess integration impact with current architecture
3. Evaluate risk mitigation strategies and success criteria

### For Implementation Teams
1. Study detailed technical specifications in approved proposals
2. Review current architecture dependencies
3. Plan implementation phases and milestones

*These recommendations represent proposed future enhancements to the PAS system. Implementation requires formal approval and should follow established change management processes.*
