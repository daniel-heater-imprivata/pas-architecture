# MITM Proxy Separation and Web Client Strategy

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation**: Extract MITM proxy functionality into independent Rust process with integrated web client support using IronRDP library to deliver December 2025 web client requirements while preserving existing audit architecture.

**Business Justification**:
- **Customer Revenue Protection**: Multi-year customer demand for web-based access with firm December deadline
- **MITM Reliability Issues**: Recent customer data loss incidents traced to MITM proxy instability
- **Protocol Currency Gap**: Hand-rolled RDP implementation missing customer-requested features available in IronRDP
- **Minimal Risk Approach**: Preserve proven audit architecture while adding web client capabilities

**Timeline**: 12 weeks to December delivery with minimal changes to existing audit architecture.

**Strategic Value**: Adds web client capabilities while preserving all existing native client functionality and proven audit architecture, delivering customer requirements with minimal risk.

## Business Context and Urgency

### Critical Issues Driving Change

#### MITM Proxy Reliability Issues
Recent customer data loss incidents have been traced to instability in the MITM proxy components, particularly in RDP connection handling. The current custom RDP implementation has edge cases that cause connection drops and audit data loss.

#### RDP Protocol Currency Gap
Our custom RDP implementation lacks features customers have requested:
- Modern codec support (RemoteFX, advanced compression)
- Enhanced security protocols
- Improved graphics performance
- Standard .rdp file support
- Advanced virtual channel support

#### Preserving Proven Audit Architecture
The existing audit system represents years of development and handles complex multi-protocol scenarios reliably. Rather than risk disrupting this proven architecture, we propose extracting only the MITM proxy layer while preserving all existing audit functionality and integration patterns.

### Customer Requirements
- **Additional web-based access** without client software installation (in addition to existing native clients)
- **Multi-protocol support** (RDP, SSH, VNC) through browser
- **Preserved native client functionality** including SSH tunneling and port forwarding
- **Multi-regulatory compliance** and audit requirements (HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, GDPR, CJIS)
- **Global deployment** support with data sovereignty compliance
- **December 2025 delivery**

## Recommended Approach: MITM Proxy Separation + Web Client

### Architecture Overview
Extract MITM proxy functionality into independent Rust process that provides:
1. **Enhanced MITM reliability** using battle-tested IronRDP library for RDP connections
2. **Integrated web client support** via WebSocket streaming to browsers
3. **Preserved audit architecture** - all existing audit functionality remains in Parent/Java
4. **Minimal integration changes** - audit logging continues through existing patterns

### Critical Scope Clarification: Addition, Not Replacement

**Web clients are an ADDITION to existing functionality, not a replacement:**

- **Native clients continue unchanged**: All existing RDP clients, SSH clients, and other native applications work exactly as before
- **SSH tunneling preserved**: SSH port forwarding and tunneling capabilities remain fully functional for native client access
- **Customer choice**: Users can choose between native clients OR web clients based on their specific needs and constraints
- **Existing workflows maintained**: Complex native client setups, automated scripts, and enterprise integrations continue operating without modification
- **Audit coverage**: Both native client connections and web client connections receive identical audit logging and credential injection

**What we're adding**: Browser-based access option for users who need clientless connectivity
**What we're NOT changing**: Any existing native client functionality, SSH tunneling capabilities, or audit architecture

### Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Basic audit separation with SSH credential injection + WebSocket foundation
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: RDP support using IronRDP + multi-protocol web client for supported protocols
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)**: Production hardening + December deployment

**Current Protocol Support Analysis**:
- **SSH**: MITM proxy with credential injection (text-based audit)
- **RDP**: X.224 credential injection with binary audit format
- **VNC**: DES challenge/response injection with binary audit format
- **Telnet**: Terminal stream injection (text-based audit)
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Regex-based credential replacement
- **Oracle**: SQL protocol injection
- **MySQL**: SQL protocol injection
- **FTP**: Command monitoring (no credential injection)
- **MSDP**: HTTP-based service discovery protocol
- **Horizon**: VMware Horizon protocol support

## Protocol Prioritization Across Phases

**Phase 1 Protocols (December 2025 Delivery)**:
- **SSH**: MITM proxy with credential injection
- **RDP**: X.224 credential injection with binary audit format
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Regex-based credential replacement (time permitting - if schedule allows)

**Phase 2 Protocols (Q1 2026)**:
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Regex-based credential replacement (if not completed in Phase 1)
- **Telnet**: Terminal stream injection (legacy protocol, declining usage)
- **FTP**: Command monitoring (legacy protocol, minimal usage)
- **VNC**: DES challenge/response injection (specialized use cases)

**Phase 3 Protocols (Q2 2026)**:
- **Oracle**: SQL protocol injection (database-specific customers)
- **MySQL**: SQL protocol injection (database-specific customers)
- **MSDP**: HTTP-based service discovery (specialized deployments)
- **Horizon**: VMware Horizon protocol (virtualization-specific customers)

**Rationale**: Phase 1 focuses on SSH and RDP which represent 80%+ of customer protocol usage. HTTP/HTTPS included as time-permitting to maximize Phase 1 value. Phase 2 covers remaining common protocols, Phase 3 handles specialized/database protocols.

### Key Benefits
- **Immediate web client delivery** for December deadline
- **Audit system reliability** improvements preventing data loss
- **Development velocity** increase
- **Protocol modernization** through IronRDP adoption
- **Operational simplification** (single component vs separate Guacamole deployment)

## Alternative Approaches Analysis

### Alternative 1: Standalone Web Proxy Service
**Timeline**: 8-10 weeks
**Approach**: Build separate web proxy service alongside existing audit system

**Pros**:
- No changes to existing audit system
- Lower perceived risk to current functionality
- Separate team can work independently

**Cons**:
- **Doesn't solve audit reliability issues** (data loss risk remains)
- **Additional operational complexity** (two services to deploy/monitor)
- **Performance overhead** (double data processing: audit + proxy)
- **Doesn't address development velocity** (rebuild cycles remain)
- **Resource duplication** (two protocol implementations)

**Rejection Rationale**: Fails to address critical audit reliability issues while adding operational complexity and performance/scalability issues.

### Alternative 2: Guacamole Integration Enhancement
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks
**Approach**: Improve existing Guacamole deployment and integration

**Pros**:
- Leverages existing Guacamole investment
- Well-understood technology stack
- Proven web client capabilities

**Cons**:
- **Deployment complexity** remains (separate application server)
- **Scaling limitations** under high load
- **Protocol translation overhead** (native → Guacamole → web)
- **Doesn't solve audit issues** (data loss risk remains)
- **Limited customization** for PAS-specific requirements

**Rejection Rationale**: Addresses web client need but fails to solve underlying audit reliability and development velocity issues. Proven not to meet scaling requirements.

### Alternative 3: Minimal Audit Changes + Separate Web Service
**Timeline**: 10-12 weeks
**Approach**: Minor audit modifications for stability + independent web service

**Pros**:
- Smaller changes to existing audit system
- Preserves current Java expertise utilization
- Incremental risk approach

**Cons**:
- **Doesn't solve development velocity** (rebuild cycles remain)
- **Partial audit reliability** improvements only
- **Still requires protocol duplication** (Java + web service)
- **Timeline risk** (two separate development tracks)
- **Misses IronRDP benefits** (protocol currency, performance)

**Rejection Rationale**: Provides partial solutions while maintaining fundamental architectural problems.

## Objection Handling

### "Why rewrite audit in Rust? Wouldn't a separate web-proxy be faster?"

**Why Rust Over Java/C++**:
- **Memory safety**: Audit system handles sensitive credential data - memory corruption bugs create security vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and no garbage collection pauses under high connection load
- **Concurrency**: Built-in async/await eliminates complex thread management for 2000+ concurrent connections
- **Team Learning**: Single developer leads implementation, team learns gradually through code review
- **IronRDP Integration**: Library is Rust-native, Java bindings would add complexity and performance overhead

**Management Concern - "All we care about is web clients!"**:
- **Fastest web client delivery**: Audit separation is prerequisite for any web client approach due to development velocity crisis
- **Risk mitigation**: Integrated approach delivers web clients in same timeline as audit-only separation
- **Operational simplicity**: Single component vs managing separate Guacamole deployment
- **Multi-regulatory compliance**: Current audit failures creating compliance risks across healthcare, financial, law enforcement, and gaming sectors

**Alternative Assessment**: Separate web-proxy still requires audit reliability fixes AND adds operational complexity without solving development velocity issues.

### "Why separate audit and Parent? We've done it this way for years."

**Critical Issues**:
- **Customer data loss** incidents due to audit system failures
- **Development velocity crisis** blocking rapid iteration (3-5 minute rebuild cycles)
- **Operational risk** where audit failures can crash entire Parent application or vice versa
- **Multi-regulatory compliance concerns** with unclear audit boundaries affecting HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, and other requirements

**Business Impact**: Current architecture is actively preventing December delivery and creating customer trust issues through data loss incidents.

### "Developers always want the latest technology and projects always fail."

**Lessons Learned from LibRSSConnect/UCM**:
- **Inadequate complexity assessment**: Initial scope underestimated protocol implementation challenges
- **Rejected strangler pattern**: Original approach allowed parallel Java/C++ deployment with early delivery potential (abandoned after first few months)
- **Too many developers**: Multiple inexperienced developers working independently created coordination overhead and inconsistent implementation
- **Third-party library issues**: libssh2 threading problems caused stability issues despite vendor claims
- **Architecture by committee**: Committee-driven redesign created overengineered, unstable solution implemented by intern
- **Scope creep**: Feature additions during development extended timeline by 6+ months
- **Insufficient load testing**: Performance issues discovered late in development cycle

**Key Lesson**: Single architectural vision focused on simplicity and early delivery for rapid feedback.

**Risk Mitigation for This Project**:
- **Honest scope assessment**: This IS a complete rewrite of audit MiTM functionality with new features from IronRDP adoption
- **Single developer control**: DH leads implementation of MiTM process
- **Incremental delivery focus**: Prioritize working web client over feature completeness
- **Early feedback loops**: Deploy SSH support first for immediate validation
- **Proven foundation**: IronRDP eliminates protocol development risk but introduces integration complexity
- **Parallel development opportunities**:
  - Audit logging separation (can be handled by other developers)
  - Web client UI (can be developed in parallel using defined WebSocket protocol)
  - Feature flag implementation for production rollout control

**Technology Choice Justification**:
- **Rust chosen for reliability**, not novelty (memory safety for audit system)
- **IronRDP chosen for completeness**, not innovation (missing features in current implementation)
- **Business-driven decision**: Customer data loss and December deadline drive technology selection

### "December deadline seems unrealistic for a rewrite."

**Honest Assessment**: This IS a complete rewrite of the audit MiTM system. Timeline needs realistic evaluation.

**Revised Timeline**: 12 weeks for Phase 1 delivery (SSH + RDP + HTTP/HTTPS if time permits)
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3)**: SSH MiTM rewrite with WebSocket streaming
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6)**: RDP integration using IronRDP with WebSocket streaming
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-9)**: Production hardening and load testing (2000+ connections)
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 10-12)**: System integration and customer rollout (HTTP/HTTPS if buffer time available)

**Phase 2 Protocols**: Q1 2026 delivery for HTTP/HTTPS, Telnet, FTP, VNC
**Phase 3 Protocols**: Q2 2026 delivery for Oracle, MySQL, MSDP, Horizon

**Parallel Development Opportunities**:
- **Java integration adaptation**: Modify existing audit code to interface with new MITM process (minimal changes)
- **Web client UI**: Can be developed using existing WebSocket protocol from PoC (recommend vanilla TypeScript, no WASM based on PoC lessons learned - best performance/simplicity). Clients are very simple HTML5.
- **MITM process development**: Independent Rust development without affecting existing audit architecture

**Performance Considerations for MiTM/Audit Separation**:
- **Risk**: Additional IPC overhead between credential injection and audit logging
- **Mitigation**: Shared memory or high-performance message queues for audit data
- **Alternative**: Keep audit generation in MiTM process, separate only audit file storage

### "Risk of disrupting existing stable systems"

**Parallel Operation Strategy**:
- **Development testing**: Run parallel implementations and compare outputs for validation
- **Production feature flags**: Database-controlled selection between old/new audit implementations
- **Incremental protocol migration**: Start with SSH, add RDP when proven stable
- **Rollback capability**: Immediate fallback to existing system via feature flag

**Gradual Migration Challenges**:
- **Operational complexity**: Running both systems simultaneously increases monitoring burden
- **Data consistency**: Ensuring audit records remain consistent during transition
- **Performance impact**: Parallel operation may affect system performance
- **Recommendation**: Rapid cutover per protocol rather than extended parallel operation

**Parent Application Changes**:
- **MITM proxy calls**: Redirect to new Rust MITM process instead of internal Java MITM
- **Audit functionality**: Remains completely unchanged in Parent/Java
- **Database integration**: Continues using existing audit patterns and connections
- **Parent UI**: Unchanged (no audit UI components affected)
- **Configuration**: Database-driven configuration (no Spring dependency in new audit process)
- **Audit file discovery**: Parent continues existing file system access patterns

**Operational Continuity**:
- **No downtime** required for initial deployment
- **Side-by-side testing** before any production traffic
- **Incremental cutover** with immediate rollback capability

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

- **Fixed scope**: Web client functionality only, no additional features
- **Clear boundaries**: Audit separation + WebSocket streaming, nothing more
- **Change control**: Any scope additions require explicit approval and timeline adjustment

## Technical Foundation

This recommendation builds on comprehensive technical analysis documented in the [pas-architecture repository](https://github.com/daniel-heater-imprivata/pas-architecture), including:

- **Current audit system architecture** analysis revealing protocol manipulation complexity
- **Credential injection requirements** for SSH, RDP, and VNC protocols
- **many-year audit linking race condition** root cause analysis and proposed solutions
- **PCAP alternative assessment** and rejection rationale
- **IronRDP capabilities analysis** demonstrating protocol currency and reliability benefits

The technical due diligence demonstrates that this approach addresses fundamental architectural issues while delivering immediate business value through web client functionality.

## Critical Assessment and Alternatives

### Honest Evaluation of Proposed Approach

**Strengths**:
- Addresses multiple critical issues simultaneously (audit reliability, development velocity, web client delivery)
- Leverages proven IronRDP library reducing protocol development risk
- Single developer control for MiTM prevents committee-driven complexity that plagued LibRSSConnect
- Provides long-term foundation for protocol modernization

**Weaknesses**:
- **Complete rewrite risk**: Despite using proven libraries, integration complexity is significant
- **Timeline pressure**: 12 weeks achievable for Phase 1 (SSH + RDP) with existing WebSocket protocol foundation
- **Technology learning curve**: Team has limited Rust experience

### Alternative Recommendation: Phased Approach

Given the December deadline pressure and lessons learned from LibRSSConnect, consider this alternative:

**Phase 1 (12 weeks): SSH + RDP + HTTP/HTTPS (time permitting)**
- Focus on SSH and RDP protocols (80%+ customer usage)
- HTTP/HTTPS implementation if buffer time allows
- Leverages existing WebSocket protocol foundation
- 3-4 weeks buffer time for quality assurance and HTTP/HTTPS if feasible

**Phase 2 (Q1 2026): Common Legacy Protocols**
- HTTP/HTTPS (if not completed in Phase 1), Telnet, FTP, VNC implementations
- Builds on proven Phase 1 foundation
- Covers remaining common protocol usage

**Phase 3 (Q2 2026): Specialized Protocols**
- Oracle, MySQL, MSDP, Horizon implementations
- Database and virtualization-specific customers
- Focused development for specialized use cases

### Final Recommendation

**Phase 1 Approach (SSH + RDP) - 12 Week Timeline**:

**Benefits**:
- Addresses 80%+ of customer protocol usage immediately
- HTTP/HTTPS bonus delivery if schedule permits (covers 90%+ usage)
- Leverages existing WebSocket protocol to eliminate integration risk
- Provides 3-4 weeks of buffer time for quality assurance and HTTP/HTTPS
- Delivers web client functionality for primary use cases by December
- Maintains audit reliability through Rust rewrite of MITM components

**Phase 2 Strategy (Q1 2026)**:
- Common legacy protocols (HTTP/HTTPS if needed, Telnet, FTP, VNC)
- Builds on proven Phase 1 foundation for faster implementation

**Phase 3 Strategy (Q2 2026)**:
- Specialized database and virtualization protocols
- Focused development for specific customer segments

**Risk Mitigation**: Existing WebSocket protocol foundation eliminates the primary technical risk. Buffer time allocation ensures quality delivery within 12-week commitment.

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals the tension between immediate business needs (December web client) and fundamental architectural improvements (audit reliability and development velocity). The integrated approach attempts to solve both simultaneously but carries significant implementation risk.

The choice depends on business priorities: customer commitment fulfillment vs. long-term system reliability and development productivity. Both approaches have merit depending on organizational risk tolerance and strategic priorities.
